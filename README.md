### What I learned

This was one of my first attempts to make a thing with css grid. I'm not very good at grid, for the most part, and tend to build most of my websites using flexbox and relative positioning but wanted to start learning how to grid a little better. I don't think it went that bad but I obviously have a long ay to go before becoming efficient at css grid.
